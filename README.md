## About the Project
This project was develop for a code challenge by ZeDelivery's Company

## Challenge 1 - Identify critical flows

#### Login
        This was the first feature I would like to test, and certainly is the most important.
        As a requirement for ordering, the customer identification is a critical flow and 
        it could impact on people become frustated and loss of money.
        
#### Change on Address Location
        This flow must be highlithed as well, after a hard day our customes would like 
        to enjoy a cold drink by the confort of their home, imagine if they have to wait two hours more
        because the address was incorrect. 
        
#### Card Item Verification
        This is another important feature, if the cart was not working properly it could cause alot of charge back.
